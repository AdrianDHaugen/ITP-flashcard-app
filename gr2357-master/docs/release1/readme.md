# Flashcards App

## Overview

The Flashcards App is a digital study tool designed to help users learn and revise topics using the proven flashcard method. Users can create decks of cards, each containing a question (or prompt) on one side and the answer on the other. The goal is to enhance memory and understanding of various subjects in an interactive and engaging manner.

## Vision

As the application evolves, we aim to introduce features like:

- Different gamemodes like:
  - `Shuffle Mode`: Shuffles the deck in a random order, to challange the user by giving them more variation.
  - `Time Challenge Mode`: Each card or the deck has limited amount of time, to challange the user to recall the answer as quickly as possible
- Enhance the UI to be more interactive and user friendly

## User Story: Basic Flashcard Study

**As** a student preparing for an upcoming test,  
**I want** to:

- Cycle through a deck of flashcards in a set order,
- Add new cards to the deck when I come across new information,
- Change the name of my deck to reflect its content,
- Save my deck to a file for backup or sharing purposes,

**So that** I can effectively review, organize, and preserve my study materials.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Sequential Navigation:** I can navigate to the next card or the previous card in the deck using clear and intuitive buttons or gestures.
2. **Addition of Cards:** From the main menu or within the deck, I can choose to add a new card, inputting both the front and back text.
3. **Deck Name Modification:** I can change the name of the deck to better describe its contents, with the new name being visibly updated and saved.
4. **Save to File:** I can save my current deck to a file format that retains the structure and content of the deck, allowing me to reload it later or share it with others.
5. **Intuitive UI:** The process to add a card, change the deck name, or save the deck to a file should be simple and intuitive, requiring no more than a few clicks or taps.
